## 📘 Hollow Progression Flow

### 1️⃣ Regular Hollow
- Weak  
- Low Reiryoka, low Control  
- Often easily dispatched by Shinigami  

### 2️⃣ Menos Grande (Gillians)
- Formed when multiple Regular Hollows merge  
- Higher Reiryoka, slightly better control  
- Dangerous in groups, can overwhelm inexperienced opponents  

### 3️⃣ Adjucha
- Evolution via consuming multiple Gillians  
- Significantly higher Reiryoka and Control  
- Tactical intelligence increases, capable of coordinated attacks  

### 4️⃣ Vasto Lorde
- Elite Hollow evolution  
- Massive Reiryoka, high Control, intelligent combatant  
- Can rival mid-tier Shinigami or Quincy  

### 5️⃣ Hōgyoku Influence
- Hōgyoku exposure → Arrancar transformation or further evolution  
- Unlocks Bankai-level threat potential / unique abilities  
- High-level players may encounter these as **boss enemies**

## 🚀 Combat Mechanics / Growth
- 🌌 Reiryoka **increases when consuming weaker Hollows**  
- ⚔️ Strength and Cero/Bala potency scale with Reiryoka  
- 💨 Sonído speed improves with control and evolution stage

## 🌀 Special Notes: Arrancar / Hōgyoku
- 🔥 **Hōgyoku-induced Arrancar** gain powers beyond normal Hollows  
- 🌌 Reiryoka often maxed / unstable if not properly controlled  
- 🧠 Intelligence threshold required to use abilities effectively  
- Boss-level enemies → perfect tests for Shinigami/Quincy players
